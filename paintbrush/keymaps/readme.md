These artsey keymaps rely on files available in the artsey qmk firmware directory.

To use these keymaps:

	1. Open the qmk artsey firmware directory https://github.com/artseyio/artsey-qmk
		
			If you have not done so already, follow Step 1 of the "How to Build" 
			instructions (Set up QMK and Clone "Early Combos" repo.)
			
	2. Open the left_hand or right_hand folder, depending on if you are building a lefty or righty paintbrush.
	3. Copy all the files EXCEPT the keymaps folder.
	4. Paste them in the appropriate keymap's folder. 
			For example, if you are building a righty keyboard with vanilla artsey, you would paste the files 
			into the folder paintbrush/keymaps/artsey_righty.
	5. When compiling this keyboard you must specify if you are compiling the righty or lefty version. 
			For example: 
				qmk compile -kb paintbrush/righty -km artsey_righty
				qmk compile -kb paintbrush/lefty -km artsey_lefty
			or
				make -j 1 paintbrush/righty:artsey_righty
				make -j 1 paintbrush/lefty:artsey_lefty

If you are using vanilla artsey, you can now compile.

If you are using artsey_lefty_colemak or artsey_righty_colemak, follow these additional instructions to 
modify artsey for the Colemak layout:

	Per the "How to modify" instructions from the artsey-qmk repo:

		"All of the ARTSEY combo behavior is defined in macros.c. The non-combo key
		behavior is defined in artsey.h. These files are autogenerated by generator.R 
		using the comma-separated definition files in artsey_combos.csv and 
		artsey_keycodes.csv. To change ARTSEY, make modifications to these files, 
		save them, and run generator.R. To run this script, you will need R installed. 
		You can download R here: https://www.r-project.org/. After you run the script, 
		replace the old macros.c and artsey.h in you keyboard folder with the new one 
		and rebuild you firmware."

To change to the Colemak home row layout, follow these steps:

	1. Download R from https://www.r-project.org/.
	2. Open artsey_keycodes.csv.
	3. Replace lines 2-7
			A,BASE,KC_A,_A_BRAC
			R,BASE,KC_R,
			T,BASE,KC_T,
			S,BASE,KC_S,_A_NUM
			E,BASE,KC_E,_A_SYM
			Y,BASE,KC_Y,
		with:
			A,BASE,KC_T,_A_BRAC
			R,BASE,KC_S,
			T,BASE,KC_R,
			S,BASE,KC_A,_A_NUM
			E,BASE,KC_N,_A_SYM
			Y,BASE,KC_E,
	4. Save and close artsey_keycodes.csv.
	5. Open artsey_combos.csv.
	6. Replace line 17
			IO,BASE,tap_code(KC_N)
		with:
			IO,BASE,tap_code(KC_Y)
	7. Save and close artsey_combos.csv.
	8. Run the generator.R script.

You can now compile your firmware as normal.
